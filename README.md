#Assignment 1B_Quest1 - Python Code for implementation of Decision Tree Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron and Average Aggregate Classifier on a data set FOREST

#Assignment 1B_Question2 - Implemntation of Multilayer Perceptron classifier on different data set and a comparitive study on performance and accuraccy score for each data set.

#part1 - Classifiers - Decision Tree and Multilayer Perceptron. Confusion Matrix 

#Assignment2_Task2 - Analysis of different clustering techniques by implementing them on 4 different data sets, and comparing their performance on four measures - Silhouette Score, Sum Square Error, Davies Bouldin, Time Taken.
#The overall winner algorithm was Agglomerative algorithm. Details of entire analysis in report.

#Assignment2_task3 - t-SNE dimensionality reduction implemented on one of the dataset used previously in Assignment2_task2
